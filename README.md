# Momentum Trading
Implementation of momentum trading using U.S. market data from 2003 to 2024

More details in [Presentation slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ly-klGXJP00pRBN3lptlji4UzezfFZwZJq_PUALpLU/edit?slide=id.g33e3490a09c_3_267#slide=id.g33e3490a09c_3_267)

## üß† Implementation Details

The **baseline momentum strategy** examines the past 1-year return of all publicly traded stocks in the U.S. market. It then takes a **long position** in the top 20% of performers and a **short position** in the bottom 20%. The portfolio is **value-weighted** and **rebalanced every 6 months** (configurable)

The **modified strategy** builds on this baseline by introducing an additional filter: it only selects stocks in the **bottom 10% of analyst coverage** (based on lagged 3-6 months residual analyst coverage) from both the long and short portfolios. This refinement results in **superior returns**.

### üìä Residual Analyst Coverage

Analyst coverage is quantified using **Residual Analyst Coverage (ResAnalyst)**, calculated as:

`ResAnalyst = Actual Number of Analysts - Predicted (from Linear Regression)`

A linear regression is fitted to model expected analyst coverage based on firm characteristics, and the residuals from this model represent the unexplained portion ‚Äî i.e., **information diffusion speed** as stated by Hong, Lim and Stein (2000).

Model 0: 
`ResAnalyst = Actual Number of Analysts` (no regression)

Model 1: 
`log(1 + Predicted) = Œ± + Œ≤‚ÇÅ √ó log(Size) + Œ≤‚ÇÇ √ó Nasdaq + Œµ`

Model 7: 
`log(1 + Predicted) = Œ± + Œ≤‚ÇÅ √ó log(Size) + Œ≤‚ÇÇ √ó Nasdaq + Œ≤‚ÇÉ √ó 1/P + Œ≤‚ÇÑ √ó Variance + Œ≤‚ÇÖ √ó R‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÜ √ó R‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚Çá √ó R‚ÇÇ + Œ≤‚Çà √ó R‚ÇÉ + Œ≤‚Çâ √ó R‚ÇÑ + Œµ`

Model 8:
`log(1 + Predicted) = Œ± + Œ≤‚ÇÅ √ó log(Size) + Œ≤‚ÇÇ √ó Nasdaq + Œ≤‚ÇÉ √ó Turnover + Œ≤‚ÇÖ √ó Turnover √ó Nasdaq + Œµ`

- `log(1 + Predicted)`: Natural log of one plus the number of predicted analysts covering the firm.
- `log(Size)`: Natural log of the firm's market capitalization.
- `Nasdaq`: Dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm is listed on Nasdaq; 0 otherwise.
- `Œµ`: Error term.
- `1/P`: 1 / Stock Price
- `Variance`: Variance of the firm's monthly returns for the past year.
- `R‚ÇÄ to R‚ÇÑ`: Annual returns lagged by 0 to 4 years, respectively.
- `Turnover`: Ratio of trading volume over the prior six months to total shares outstanding.

## Setup Instructions

### Compatibility
python >=3.9,<=3.12

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xuanvietchu/Momentum-Trading.git
cd Momentum-Trading
```

### üì• Download Data

Download the required dataset from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oNgrl9AGhgINerKbnNA3SlnJty-CsLpH?usp=sharing).

Before placing the files, make sure to create the following folders in the root directory of the project:
```bash
mkdir benchmark_data
mkdir data
mkdir models_data
mkdir processed_data
mkdir result
```

After downloading, place the files into their respective directories so that your project structure resembles the following:

```bash
Momentum-Trading/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ benchmark_data/  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ market.CSV  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stnum.CSV  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ VW_benchmark.CSV  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IBES_eps_quarters_2003_2024.csv  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stock_price_monthly_2003_2024.csv
```

### üêç For pip + virtualenv users:
```bash
python -m venv env_fin
source env_fin/bin/activate  # or `env_fin\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### Step 1: Preprocessing

Execute the following Jupyter notebooks in order to clean and prepare the data:

1. Open `clean.ipynb` from the `preprocess` folder and run all cells.
   > üí° Make sure to select the `env_fin` Python kernel. If you don't see it listed, try reopening the `Momentum-Trading` folder with VSCode and reactivating the `env_fin` environment.

2. Open `baseline_preprocess.ipynb` and run all cells.
3. Open `proxy_preprocess.ipynb` and run all cells.

You can run these in Jupyter Notebook or any IDE that supports `.ipynb` files (e.g., VSCode, JupyterLab).

If the notebooks run successfully, your project directory should now include:
```bash
Momentum-Trading/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmodels_data/
‚îÇ       ibes_eps_semi_annual_by_date_2003_2024.csv
‚îÇ       stock_price_monthly_2003_2024.csv
```
---


### Step 2: Configure the Model (Optional)

If needed, customize parameters or strategy logic by editing the model's configuration:
- `config/` folder for constants and parameters

---

### Step 3: Run Strategies

Run the following Python scripts to execute the trading strategies:

```bash
# Run baseline strategy
python ./models/baseline.py

# Run modified strategy
python ./models/modified.py

# Run benchmark
python ./benchmark/benchmark.py

# Run market
python ./benchmark/market.py
```

### Step 4: Statistical Testing

Use these scripts to evaluate strategy performance with statistical tests:
```bash
# Paired t-test between strategies
python ./t_test/t_test.py

# Compare strategy to benchmark
python ./t_test/test_benchmark.py

# Compare screening variables
python ./t_test/v1_vs_v2.py
```
